## Overview

### *The Assignment*

The Module 13 Challenge 

We were provided the `spam_detector.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook with starter code to accomplish our assignment.

### *Written in*

Jupyter Notebook using Python v3.10.13, Pandas, and scikit-learn

### *Accessing the notebook*

To access the spam detector notebook, simply download the `.ipynb` file `spam_detector.ipynb` into a local directory, then load the `spam_detector.ipynb` file into Jupyter Notebook through your terminal.

---

## Execution

### *How to use*

Simply `Run All Cells` to execute the code in every cell of the notebook in sequence. Alternatively, each cell may be `Run` on its own, though it is still recommended to run them in order.

### *Breaking down the code*

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the various cells coded within the `spam_detector.ipynb` notebook.

[^2]: Markdown cells for instructions not annotated

[^3]: Denotes cells with completed code provided, no student coding contained

[^4]: Markdown cells for student responses

[^5]: Used of `random_state=13` chosen to maintain consistent testing during development, as no instruction to use any `random_state` argument was provided

[^6]: Denotes cells with `import`s provided, all remaining coding by student

[^7]: Provided variable `testing_predictions` renamed to `lr_predictions` or `rf_predictions` to maintain distinct prediction variables for both models

[^8]: Cell added to further support predictions made prior to `cell 3`
